# ⚠️ LANGUAGE RULE — MANDATORY

<!-- misfire-rule:begin -->
## ZURAFFA MISFIRE RULE (HARD, NON-NEGOTIABLE — HARDCODED TOP RULE)

**On ANY misfire (test failure, compilation error, runtime crash, unexpected output) related to zuraffa:**

1. **STOP IMMEDIATELY** on the first misfire.
2. **Report the issue** to zuraffa GitHub (`arrrrny/zuraffa`) with: the command that failed, expected vs actual output, and root cause.
3. **Continue with a workaround** to make the task pass (e.g., skip the failing test, use an alternative approach, or mock the failing component).
4. **Add a comment** in the code explaining the workaround applied and linking to the zuraffa GitHub issue.

**On ANY misfire related to the repo itself (not zuraffa):**

1. **STOP IMMEDIATELY** on the first misfire.
2. **Report the issue** to the repo's GitHub with full details.
3. **Continue with a workaround** to make the task pass.
4. **Add a comment** in the code explaining the workaround applied.

This rule takes precedence over all other rules. Never skip a misfire or rationalize it away.

<!-- pool-pr:begin -->
## The forklift pool owns the PR — never merge a pull request yourself

Every pull request in these repos is reviewed by the **forklift pool**
(`arrrrny/forklift` — the local PR-review pipeline). It mints three tasks, in
this order, and that chain is the only sanctioned way from "PR opened" to "PR
merged":

1. `PR review <repo>#<n>` — the automated review; it posts its actionable
   findings on the PR.
2. `Apply review fixes <repo>#<n>` — one fixes round, pushed onto the PR's
   branch.
3. `Merge PR <repo>#<n>` — the merge itself; the task refuses while reviewer
   findings are still unaddressed.

**Never merge or close a PR by hand, and never merge one because it "looks
finished".** A hand merge lands the code while findings are still open: the
pool's fixes task is then killed by its closed-PR guard — the dispatcher log
says `…#<n> is closed — cancelled, no agent started` — and every finding the
review posted is dropped with nobody to own it. That is not a review, it is a
race the pipeline cannot win.

**Wait for the pool, and read the pool for the state.** The three task rows are
the truth; the PR page is not:

```bash
# the pool's board — loopback, IPv4-only (never `localhost`)
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8888/tasks \
  | jq -r '.[] | select(.title | test("PR review|Apply review fixes|Merge PR")) \
          | [.title, .status, .id] | @tsv'
```

One row per stage. `status` is one of `queued`, `running`, `done`, `failed`,
`needsInput`, `cancelled`, `paused`. The PR is done when the
`Merge PR <repo>#<n>` row reads `done`. A fixes row that reads `failed` or
`cancelled` means the PR was **not** reviewed-and-fixed: read the row's
`errorMessage`, fix the cause, and let the pipeline requeue it (relabelling a
failed task requeues it in the same call — `POST /tasks/<id>/label`).

**An agent can simply wait for the whole process** — poll the board above until
the `Merge PR` row is terminal. Everything else is the pool's job: it drives
the review, the fixes round and the merge.
<!-- pool-pr:end -->

<!-- tmp-clone:begin -->
## Work in a `/tmp` clone — never in `~/Developer`

Every piece of work on a PR or an issue happens in its own clone under `/tmp`,
and that clone dies with the task:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git /tmp/<repo>-<pr-or-issue>
```

Never clone into `~/Developer`, and never clone into the forklift checkout —
a bare repo slug as the clone target is how a stray checkout ends up inside the
repo root, and a clone left behind in `~/Developer` is indistinguishable from
the primary checkout. The pool's lanes already mint their clones this way
(`/tmp/fix-pr-<n>`, `/tmp/review-pr-<n>`, `/tmp/issue-<n>`, …) and remove them
when the task settles.
<!-- tmp-clone:end -->

**ALL responses MUST be in English ONLY. Never respond in Turkish, Chinese, or any other language, regardless of the user's locale or the presence of non-English content in the codebase. This is a hard rule with no exceptions.**

# AGENTS.md

Go 1.26+ proxy server providing OpenAI/Gemini/Claude/Codex compatible APIs with OAuth and round-robin load balancing.

## 🔍 Code Search — MANDATORY FIRST STEP

**STOP. Before using `grep`, `find`, `rg`, `ripgrep`, or ANY shell-based search, you MUST use semantic search first.**

```bash
# THIS is how you search code — ALWAYS FIRST:
mcp__claude_context__search_code(query="what you're looking for", path="/absolute/path/to/repo")
```

**Why?** Semantic search understands code relationships, finds implementations by meaning (not just text), and catches things grep misses entirely.

**Rules:**
1. **ALWAYS** start with `mcp__claude_context__search_code` for code discovery
2. **ONLY** fall back to `grep`/`find`/`rg` when:
   - You need an EXACT literal string match (e.g., a specific error message)
   - The semantic search index is unavailable/broken
   - You're searching for file names, not code content
3. **NEVER** use grep as your first code search tool — it's slower and less accurate

**Indexing:** If search fails with "not indexed", run `mcp__claude_context__index_codebase(path="/absolute/path")` first, then retry.

## 📚 Zread Wiki — Check First

**Before diving into source code, check if a zread wiki exists for this project:**

```bash
# Check if wiki exists:
cat .zread/wiki/current 2>/dev/null && echo "Wiki exists" || echo "No wiki"

# If wiki exists, read the pages directly:
ls .zread/wiki/versions/$(cat .zread/wiki/current)/

# To regenerate wiki (if stale):
zread generate --stdio
```

**Why?** Zread generates comprehensive documentation from code. Reading the wiki is faster than crawling source files manually.

**Rules:**
1. **ALWAYS** check `.zread/wiki/current` before reading source files
2. If wiki exists, read the markdown pages directly — they're already indexed
3. If wiki is missing or stale, run `zread generate --stdio` to create it
4. Wiki pages live in `.zread/wiki/versions/<id>/` — read `wiki.json` for the TOC

## Repository
- GitHub: https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI

## Commands
```bash
gofmt -w . # Format (required after Go changes)
go build -o cli-proxy-api ./cmd/server # Build
go run ./cmd/server # Run dev server
go test ./... # Run all tests
go test -v -run TestName ./path/to/pkg # Run single test
go build -o test-output ./cmd/server && rm test-output # Verify compile (REQUIRED after changes)
```
- Common flags: `--config <path>`, `--tui`, `--standalone`, `--local-model`, `--no-browser`, `--oauth-callback-port <port>`

## Config
- Default config: `config.yaml` (template: `config.example.yaml`)
- `.env` is auto-loaded from the working directory
- Auth material defaults under `auths/`
- Storage backends: file-based default; optional Postgres/git/object store (`PGSTORE_*`, `GITSTORE_*`, `OBJECTSTORE_*`)

## Architecture
- `cmd/server/` — Server entrypoint
- `internal/api/` — Gin HTTP API (routes, middleware, modules)
- `internal/api/modules/amp/` — Amp integration (Amp-style routes + reverse proxy)
- `internal/thinking/` — Main thinking/reasoning pipeline. `ApplyThinking()` (apply.go) parses suffixes (`suffix.go`, suffix overrides body), normalizes config to canonical `ThinkingConfig` (`types.go`), normalizes and validates centrally (`validate.go`/`convert.go`), then applies provider-specific output via `ProviderApplier`. Do not break this "canonical representation → per-provider translation" architecture.
- `internal/runtime/executor/` — Per-provider runtime executors (incl. Codex WebSocket)
- `internal/translator/` — Provider protocol translators (and shared `common`)
- `internal/registry/` — Model registry + remote updater (`StartModelsUpdater`); `--local-model` disables remote updates
- `internal/store/` — Storage implementations and secret resolution
- `internal/managementasset/` — Config snapshots and management assets
- `internal/cache/` — Request signature caching
- `internal/watcher/` — Config hot-reload and watchers
- `internal/wsrelay/` — WebSocket relay sessions
- `internal/usage/` — Usage and token accounting
- `internal/tui/` — Bubbletea terminal UI (`--tui`, `--standalone`)
- `sdk/cliproxy/` — Embeddable SDK entry (service/builder/watchers/pipeline)
- `test/` — Cross-module integration tests

## Code Conventions
- Keep changes small and simple (KISS)
- Comments in English only
- If editing code that already contains non-English comments, translate them to English (don’t add new non-English comments)
- For user-visible strings, keep the existing language used in that file/area
- New Markdown docs should be in English unless the file is explicitly language-specific (e.g. `README_CN.md`)
- As a rule, do not make standalone changes to `internal/translator/`. You may modify it only as part of broader changes elsewhere.
- If a task requires changing only `internal/translator/`, run `gh repo view --json viewerPermission -q .viewerPermission` to confirm you have `WRITE`, `MAINTAIN`, or `ADMIN`. If you do, you may proceed; otherwise, file a GitHub issue including the goal, rationale, and the intended implementation code, then stop further work.
- `internal/runtime/executor/` should contain executors and their unit tests only. Place any helper/supporting files under `internal/runtime/executor/helps/`.
- Follow `gofmt`; keep imports goimports-style; wrap errors with context where helpful
- Do not use `log.Fatal`/`log.Fatalf` (terminates the process); prefer returning errors and logging via logrus
- Shadowed variables: use method suffix (`errStart := server.Start()`)
- Wrap defer errors: `defer func() { if err := f.Close(); err != nil { log.Errorf(...) } }()`
- Use logrus structured logging; avoid leaking secrets/tokens in logs
- Avoid panics in HTTP handlers; prefer logged errors and meaningful HTTP status codes
- Timeouts are allowed only during credential acquisition; after an upstream connection is established, do not set timeouts for any subsequent network behavior. Intentional exceptions that must remain allowed are the Codex websocket liveness deadlines in `internal/runtime/executor/codex_websockets_executor.go`, the wsrelay session deadlines in `internal/wsrelay/session.go`, the management APICall timeout in `internal/api/handlers/management/api_tools.go`, and the `cmd/fetch_antigravity_models` utility timeouts

## Fork Upstream Sync Policy (MANDATORY)

This repo (`arrrrny/CLIProxyAPIPlus`) is a **fork** of `router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI`. The `sync` branch carries fork-owned providers upstream will never accept — kiro, cursor, codebuddy, github-copilot, gitlab, kilo, gemini-cli, the dedicated model providers, the AMP module registry, the fork's OAuth model alias defaults, and the selection-time model-exclusion guard. The upstream sync MUST preserve them. See `.github/UPSTREAM-SYNC-POLICY.md`.

- **Never auto-resolve conflicts in favor of upstream.** `git checkout --theirs`, `git merge -X theirs`, and `git merge -s ours` are forbidden against upstream. On any conflict, abort, open a `sync`-labeled issue, and resolve by hand on a `sync/fork-sync-resolution` branch.
- **After a clean merge, verify `.github/FORK_OWNED_FILES`.** A clean merge can overwrite fork code without conflicting. When you add or change a fork-owned file, append it with a fork-unique survival marker.
- **Never push a merged tree that fails `go build ./...`.**
- The `-X theirs` sync is banned outright. `.github/workflows/sync-and-release.yml` implemented it and has been deleted — do not reintroduce it. `sync-upstream.yml` is the source of truth.

## Pull Request Policy (MANDATORY)

**ALL pull requests MUST target THIS FORK (`arrrrny/CLIProxyAPIPlus`) ONLY.**

- **NEVER open pull requests to upstream (`router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI`).** This is an absolute rule with no exceptions.
- When creating PRs, ALWAYS use `--repo arrrrny/CLIProxyAPIPlus` or ensure the PR targets the fork.
- If you accidentally create an upstream PR, close it immediately.
- Work stays on the fork. The owner decides when and how to contribute to upstream.

**Note:** `AGENTS.md` cannot be changed by a pull request — `agents-md-guard.yml` auto-closes any PR that touches it. Edit it via a direct push to `sync`, as done here.

<!-- local-ci:begin -->
## Running CI locally — `scripts/local_ci.sh`

GitHub Actions is billing-blocked on our private repos: every workflow run ends in
~3s with **zero steps executed**, so a red check here means nothing. Run the same
gate locally instead:

```bash
./scripts/local_ci.sh              # every job of the pull_request workflow
./scripts/local_ci.sh --plan       # print every step that would run, run nothing
./scripts/local_ci.sh --list       # workflows, triggers and jobs in this repo
./scripts/local_ci.sh --job <id>   # one job only
./scripts/local_ci.sh --event push # simulate the push-triggered workflow
./scripts/local_ci.sh --keep-going # do not stop at the first failure
./scripts/local_ci.sh -v           # echo each command before running it
```

It reads `.github/workflows/*` at run time and executes that workflow's jobs and
steps in order, so it cannot drift from CI — it is not a second copy of the gate.
Edit the workflow and the local run changes with it. Exit 0 means every executed
step passed.

What it cannot reproduce, and prints on startup instead of guessing:

- **Linux.** CI runs `ubuntu-latest`; this runs on macOS. The step set is the
  same, the platform is not. `sudo apt-get install` steps are mapped to a local
  presence probe rather than silently passed.
- **GitHub context.** A step needing `${{ secrets.* }}`, `${{ inputs.* }}`,
  `${{ vars.* }}`, `${{ steps.* }}` or `${{ github.event.* }}` is SKIPPED with the
  reason printed, never run with a guessed value.
- **`uses:` actions** are not executed. Toolchain setups (`setup-dart`,
  `setup-node`, `flutter-action`, `rust-toolchain`, …) become a version assertion
  against the local tool; checkout/cache/artifact are noted as no-ops; anything
  else is skipped by name. A Windows-runner job is skipped outright.
- **Cargo cross targets.** A step that builds for a rust cross target (e.g.
  `cargo build --target wasm32-wasip2`) is answered against this host's
  toolchain: a rustup toolchain carrying EVERY target the step asks for is used
  for that step — selected through the rustup proxy (`RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN`), so
  `cargo +<toolchain>` keeps working — and when no local toolchain carries them
  the step is SKIPPED with the reason printed (`rustup target add <target>`) —
  never a red step that says nothing about the repo. The toolchain the workflow
  pins wins over another one that merely happens to carry the target. A host
  with no rust toolchain at all is a MISSING TOOLCHAIN, not a missing target:
  the step FAILS, as this script's convention says.
- **`container:`** jobs run on the host toolchain, not in the declared image.
- **`continue-on-error: true`** steps are advisory locally, exactly as in CI.
- **Local-only checkout state.** CI checks out the committed tree; this checkout
  also has gitignored and untracked paths, which whole-tree commands (e.g.
  `dart analyze .`) see. A step that fails naming only such paths is reported as
  a LOCAL-ONLY failure, not as a CI failure — pass `--strict` to count it anyway.
  A step that would `git clone` over a sibling checkout that already exists here
  is skipped; `--allow-outside-clone` forces it.

Canonical copy: `arrrrny/forklift` → `scripts/local_ci.sh` (reference:
`docs/forklift-scripts.md`).

<!-- test-concurrency:begin -->
## Test concurrency (fleet guard)

Cap test concurrency at **2** — one un-capped `flutter test` fan starved the
shared host's services once (load 260; arrrrny/forklift#176).

There is **no config-file knob for `flutter test`**: it ignores
`dart_test.yaml` entirely (its only test-config file is
`flutter_test_config.dart`, an execution hook), so the flag is the only
lever — and it must be passed every time:

```sh
flutter test --concurrency=2
dart test -j 2
```

A repo whose `dart_test.yaml` carries `concurrency: 2` already defaults to it
for `dart test`; pass the flag anyway when you override it, and never raise
the number on a host that also runs the forklift pool. CI carries the same
flags in `.github/workflows`.
